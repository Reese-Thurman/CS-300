CS-300 Projects (Data Structures and Algorithms)
1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
> The projects in this course culminated in the the development of an application for ABC University (ABCU). This software provides computer science advisors access to course information for students. The primary problem within these projects involved the development of data structures that could efficiently store, retrieve, and print course information. 

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
> I approached the problem by comparing and contrasting various data structures, such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to determine the most efficient method of storing and retrieving data. It is important to understand the data structures used to complete the application in order to ensure the application used minimal system resources for execution.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
> Implementing the binary search tree for this course was difficult because it required the implementation of linked lists and more advanced algorithms to search and remove bid data. Linked lists are particularly challenging because they require use of pointers and dynamic memory management, concepts which require careful thought and accuracy. Memory leaks, dereferencing, and incorrect transversal are common pitfalls when using pointers to create and maintain linked lists. These challenges were addressed using debugging tools along with trial and error. This proved to be a successful approach to overcoming the challenge of integrating linked lists into the binary search tree data structure.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
> This course offered opportunities for me to receive continuous feedback from my professor throughout the term in preparation for my final projects. This opportunity changed my software development strategy so that I could incorporate feedback and refine my project each week. Continuous feedback is an important part of the iterative approach to software development because it allows the programmer to refine the software project throughout the software development lifecycle. I will continue to incorporate feedback throughout the entire software development lifecycle to minimize errors in my code.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
> In preparation for the final project, I ensured the program was maintainable, readable, and adaptable by including inline comments, distinct functions, and limited code in the main function. This approach was very effective because I was able to reuse code developed earlier in the course for my final project. I will continue to use this approach for future software projects.
